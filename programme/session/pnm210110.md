presentation-description: "<strong>Detecting New Informal Settlements using Satellite Images, AI, and Mobile Apps</strong><br>Niccolo Dejito<br>The talk will be about a project we did at Thinking Machines that combined AI, satellite images, and mobile apps to quickly and efficiently detect new informal settlements across Colombia. The purpose is to assist humanitarian organizations in locating communities in need of aid, especially in light of the recent Venezuelan economic crisis and ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

<strong>Interpretable Poverty Mapping using Social Media Data, Satellite Images, and Open Geospatial Data</strong><br>Chiara Ledesma<br>Access to accurate, granular, and up-to-date poverty data is essential for humanitarian organizations to identify vulnerable areas for poverty alleviation efforts. Recent works have shown success in combining computer vision and satellite imagery for poverty estimation; however, the cost of acquiring high-resolution images coupled with black box models can be a barrier to adoption for many development organizations. In this study, we present an interpretable and cost-efficient approach to poverty estimation using machine learning and readily accessible data sources including social media data, low-resolution satellite images, and volunteered geographic information. Using our method, we achieve an R2 of 0.66 for wealth estimation in the Philippines, compared to 0.63 using computer vision. Finally, we use feature importance analysis to identify the highest contributing features both globally and locally to help decision makers gain deeper insights into poverty.
