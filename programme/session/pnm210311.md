presentation-description: "<strong>Land-use History of Urban Wetlands in Davao City</strong><br>Lemuel Manalo<br>The study calculated the loss of urban wetlands' geo-spatial extent due to rapid urbanization over the years. Main method was through desktop mapping using Land Satellite imagery capture and historical aerial photos. The study presented the landuse changes of urban wetlands in the city during 1930s-1990s, and especially the developing years in 2000s to present time.

<strong>Supervised Simple and Basic Crop Mapping using SNAP </strong><br>Xyza Vasily Dela Pena<br>Knowledge of the growth cycle or calendar of crops is essential for the accurate interpretation of remote sensing data. The cropping calendar covers the period from land preparation, planting, growth, pollination, senescence of harvesting. This task aims to do the first and basic steps in classification in order to be familiar with the SNAP features. The land used in the task is an agricultural area in Spain. Data are from Sentinel-2 LAND01.
