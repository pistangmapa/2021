While wardrobe (or any other) video conferencing bloopers tend to become memorable, we want you (the participants) to remember PnM 2021 for our presenters’ insights and messages. With this in mind, and with the goal of a smooth and enjoyable Pista, the organizing team has crafted a short supplement to our [Code of Conduct]({{ site.baseurl }}/conference/code-of-conduct).

## General Guidelines
- If you enable your camera or plan to share your screen, take the necessary precautions to safeguard your private and personal information.
- If you’re sharing your camera, sit against a clean and non-distracting background.
- Please (casually) dress appropriately.
- Ensure the lighting is appropriate.
- Ensure that your mic volume is appropriate, and mute it when you’re not speaking.
- And lastly, enjoy!

## Joining the sessions
- For your in-session identifier please use the following format: [firstname or nickname] [lastname – optional] ([affiliation or current location]) e.g. Juan Tamad (Manila, Ph), Jose (Bicol University)

## Asking a question
- You can submit questions at any time on the Q&A function of the Zoom webinar.
- Our moderators would strive to queue them on a first in first out basis. (Related questions might be lumped together.)
- By default questions would be read by our Master of Ceremony (MoC) during the alloted Q & A timeslot.
- Should the opportunity allow it, participants will be prompted by our Session director or MoC to ask your question live (unfortunately no guarantees!)
- We encourage our participants to speak, write, and ask in a language they are comfortable with. By default Filipino and English should be OK. For others Philippine languanges we’ll definitely try, however we cannot guarantee translation for all languages.
- Should any questions be left unanswered (e.g. time runs out), we’ll ask our presenters to answers though chat or through the comment section of our social media channels.

## Workshops
- By default the same rules apply for workshops, unless explicitly modified by the workshop facilitator.
- As the need arises workshop facilitators are allowed aply their own session guidelines consistent with our CoC.
